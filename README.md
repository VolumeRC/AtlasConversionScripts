Atlas Conversion Scripts
========================

Introduction
-------------
This repository contains some scripts to help converting a 3D volume data into a WebGL compatible 2D texture atlas.

The scripts allow you to generate an atlas from different types of volume data sources. This are the supported data types:
*	Common image formats like __PNG__, __JPEG__ ... which are supported with PIL
*	__DICOM__
*	__RAW__  

Also, there is a template script you can use to adapt it to your own volume data type.

You can found the necessary information about how you can use the scripts and how to visualize the atlas on the [wiki](https://github.com/VolumeRC/AtlasConversionScripts/wiki).
